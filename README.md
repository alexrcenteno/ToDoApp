## DEVELOPERS

### Description
A simple to do application so you can make tasks for a later date and mark as completed, to keep you organized and up to date with chores or tasks. This was a project assinged by our bootcamp instructors at Actualize. It was our first time working in groups.

#### Usage 
Our MVP(minimum viable product) consits of a user able to sign up, log in, create and mark tasks and organize them into categories. They can also add new categories to new tasks and view them as well. Each to do can have multiple categories, and to do's can be sorted by categories. Back end code consists of user, to do, category, and category todo database models. 

##### Date Started/Completed
     2/8/23-2/10/23
###### Status: Incomplete
